# Introduction to Data Types and Variables
## Data types
Like in most programming languages, C++ has these basic variable types: _int_, _float_, _string_, _char_, _bool_ (boolean). A char is a single character that is enclosed with single quotation marks so that C++ knows that it is a character and not a string. 

## How to declare string
_Strings_ can only be enclosed in double quotation marks unlike Python which can be enclosed with either quotation marks, C++ does this 
to make it easier to determine if a variable is a char or string. 

## String library
The <string> library must be manually imported into a file because the string library is not a native C++ library. 

## Constant variable
A _constant variable_ (const int x) is a variable that cannot be modified once declared.

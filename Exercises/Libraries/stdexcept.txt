In C++, there is a library called <stdexcept> which includes a wide range of functions that can be used to handle runtime errors ONLY

std::exception
•   The base class for all standard exceptions. This is typically what you catch if you want to handle a broad category of errors.

std::invalid_argument
•   Thrown when an invalid argument is passed to a function. This is useful for functions that require parameters to be within a certain 
range or format.

std::out_of_range
•   Thrown when an access exceeds the bounds of a container or a permissible range. Useful for containers like std::vector, or when 
handling numeric limits.

std::length_error
•   Thrown when a function attempts to create a container with a length that exceeds its maximum size.

std::domain_error
•   Thrown when a mathematical function is given an argument that is outside of its defined domain (e.g., taking the square root of a 
    negative number).

std::overflow_error
•   Thrown when an arithmetic operation results in an overflow.
